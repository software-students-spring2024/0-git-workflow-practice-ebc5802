# Software Engineer vs. Machine Learning Engineer
In my previous semester, I took a machine learning class in NYU Abu Dhabi where I learned the fundamental building blocks of AI models. When working on my [final project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GZeOO7GgQopp6-Y5Fbok_l3-xr3c-M8c?usp=sharing), I was surprised when the implementation of the complex theorhetical concepts in class could be encapsulated in one line in PyTorch. If using ML models in the real world was as simple as calling a Python library, what is use of distinguishing someone as a machine learning engineer?

I believe the robot analogy presented in this [article](https://sertiscorp.medium.com/machine-learning-engineer-vs-software-engineer-what-are-the-differences-a4047a8a8c2e) captures the difference between SWEs and ML Engineers quite well:

> when developing a robot, a software engineer would build the robot and **write the code that instructs the robot on how to move its arms and legs to walk**. Meanwhile, a machine learning engineer would **develop a model that serves as the robot’s ‘brain,’** teaching it how to think, interpret conversations, and respond appropriately.

ML Engineers must understand the inner workings of a model in order to fine tune features for ideal functionalities. SWEs build programs which utilize the models' functionalities to achieve the end user's goal. Knowing this, I want to become a ML Engineer and learn how to build better brains and make AI workflows less empirical.

Joyce Xie: This article helps me understand the key differences between ML engineers and Software enigneers. Software engineers build the frameworks and ML engineers train the performances of the software. Two roles are equally important and must collaborate for better outcomes.
